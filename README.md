Hello!

- I'm teaching myself programming languages, concepts, and best practices while simultaneously attending university for Computer Science.
- I'm currently learning C++ and working through some projects in order to force myself to learn how to do things.
- Please feel free to leave comments/critiques on any of my repositories as I would appreciate the feedback!

Respectfully,
Kodama
